<p>The meaning of the word here is, without doubt, never fixed, but it is always referential. Here always refers to me, the speaker, the body that enunciates it. And here is always certain: there is always a here. “I’m Always Here” addresses the meaning, language, and condition of being in here through artworks that explore space as both an individual and collective concept as well as embodied, physical, and virtual.
