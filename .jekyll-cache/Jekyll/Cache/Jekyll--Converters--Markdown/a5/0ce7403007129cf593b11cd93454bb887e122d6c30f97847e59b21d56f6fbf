<p>The way we imagine machines see us is imbued with our own biased perceptions and expectations, and nothing like the way machines actually see us. In this work, I use the medium of dance to show how machines can digest the dynamic forms of human bodies in different genres of music-driven movement. As we marvel at the patterns detected by computer vision and free of the human way of looking, we begin to understand how to see the world the way machines do.</p>
