"The most dangerous silence is noise."<br />

<p>What you hear cannot be undone, just as what you’ve done cannot be altered. Our lives are inundated with noise, from sounds we don’t want to hear waking us up, to fake news we don’t want to pay attention to, from rumor and gossip beyond our control or ability to explicate, to misinformation designed to trigger our behaviors. To show the way noise disguised as real information impinges on our consciousness, we created a narrative intervention that follows our consciousness taking stock of our dreams and ideas as the metaphor of a train traveling through a landscape of machine-learning generated landscapes and machine-learning sorted voices. The journey is based around the arrival of the train at a location dreamt up by the machine as a cross between Rueon, France, and Yokohama, Japan, where a person we have known all our lives stands up and exits the train. That character contains the characteristics of multiple people in our lives, just as the landscape transitions between many places we know by an exploration in machine-learned latent spaces. Voices and sounds are interspersed in each location using spheres of deformations of space in VR, and exploring them triggers spatial audio that is grouped using a machine learning algorithm. Together the visual and audio exploration narrates the scenario of the arrival of the train, where our intimate character steps off without saying goodbye, while we summon up our resolve to create an environment to discredit the information source, to finally say goodbye ourselves, to turn off the sound.</p>
