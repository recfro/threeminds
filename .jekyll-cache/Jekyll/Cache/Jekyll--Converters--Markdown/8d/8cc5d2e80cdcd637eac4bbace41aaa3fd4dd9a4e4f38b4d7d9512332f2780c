<p>Currently, Machine Learning (ML) is employed to extend human capabilities to realms where extensive data access provide opportunities for associations previously unexploited by human artists. These examples take the human point of view first and merely expand their abilities, include generating novel musical combinations based on a palette of tones and analyzing image content to pick out image transformations styles. While these applications rely on ML as a data mining agent over unexplored domains, they fail to exceed the limit of human expectations of what they do. A different approach is to make ML agents part of a human ecosystem of creative works, exploiting our assumptions about what machines that have humanoid behaviors can or should do. Here, we use Artificial Intelligence (AI) in unexpected ways in everything we interact with, building objects that don‚Äôt follow rules we expect. Applying ML to unexpected forms of interactions subverts what we think machines are capable of, creating situations where AI goes beyond human expectation of what machine intelligence should mean to us, making them oddly, Artistically Intelligent.</p>
