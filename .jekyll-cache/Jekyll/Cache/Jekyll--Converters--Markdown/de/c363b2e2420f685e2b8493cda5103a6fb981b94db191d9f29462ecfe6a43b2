<p>We are here to watch. We are going to. We live in a world inundated by technology, but even the newest technology comes about by evolution from previous forms. Just as the rain forest covered our world, providing a canopy for the development of species connected to each other in an environment, the television and screen-based interfaces today is the canopy for a network that connect humans together in a social network. Can the forest and the internet of things be part of the same evolutionary track? Where we are before is part of where we are now, which is the how we can begin to understand our future.</p>

<p>Imitations of Immortality is a book and also lives on the web. For more info, see our online exhibition: <a href="https://raylc.org/imitations/index.html">LC (2020)</a>.</p>
