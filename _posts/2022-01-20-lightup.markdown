"If you want to know how much darkness there is around you,<br>
you must sharpen your eyes, peering at the faint lights in the distance.<br>
<i>Invisible Cities</i> by Italo Calvino<br><br>

The city we imagine together is our collective we. Light Up uses over 4000 photos of Hong Kong in the day and light time to generate a collective moment of the city going into darkness as lights come on, an unreal version of the city from the lens of machine learning. Programming by Zhiyuan Zhang.

Light Up is a Machine-Learning generated experience using StyleGANS2 (visuals) and GanSynth (music). Light Up was exhibited at the immersive exhibition Light Up at [Goethe Institute, Hong Kong Arts Centre](https://www.goethe.de/ins/hon/en/ver.cfm?event_id=23590037) curated by Zoe Chan. It was shown at Mind(e)scape at [Soho House Hong Kong](https://www.instagram.com/tv/CfndrgSlYTA/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link) curated by Linda Cheung.
