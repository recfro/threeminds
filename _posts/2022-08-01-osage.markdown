The meaning of the word here is, without doubt, never fixed, but it is always referential. Here always refers to me, the speaker, the body that enunciates it. And here is always certain: there is always a here. "I'm Always Here" addresses the meaning, language, and condition of being in here through artworks that explore space as both an individual and collective concept as well as embodied, physical, and virtual. Here's Osage Gallery and Osage Art Foundation's [press release][link4].

At the Osage exhibition, we grouped together three of our works that narrate the notion of machine interpretation of presence through three different media of TV video, projection, and virtual reality. CATCH AND RELEASE examines the way machines see our movements, providing surprising interpretations of human existence not seen when seeing the video only from the human perspective. HOME AONE shows the way machines can interpolate between the different ways we see our spaces from quarantine to luxury space to eventually being abandoned. SOUND OF(F) narrates the reality of dreams through a sonic exploration that converts temporal sequence of music and sound to a spatial experience using machine learning. Our exhibition info is at: [LC (2021)][show].
